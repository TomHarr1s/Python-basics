#To start of with you need to learn how to print text you would do this by typing this:

print("Hello world")

#Under this make it print Hello my name is Myles


#Next you need to learn how to instert variables you would do this by:

my_variable = 10

#This would assign the value "10" the the variable "my_variable"
#You can then make it print the variable by:

my_variable = 10
print (my_variable)

#If you want to print speech marks you have to put a backslah in front of them for example:

print("\"Helloworld\"")

#Now try it yourself below:


#You can also use booleans to assign true or false to a variable by:

my_bool = True

#This will assign true to the variable my_bool

#As you can see we have used "#" to write comments what every you write on the line of a "#" will not effect you code:

#Like this

#You can also use three " so that you can have multipul lines of comments like this (can't see on github):

"""A
B
C
D
"""

#You can also do maths calculations using Python

addition = 72 + 53
subtraction = 109 - 54
Multiply = 25 * 3
divide = 6 / 3 
To the power of = 10 ** 2
Remainded (answer will be the remained 1) = 3 % 2
